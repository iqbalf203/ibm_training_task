            Thankyou for showing interest,
            here is a quick story of me and
            this website. My programming
            journey started back in 2020,
            a year after I started
            studying ECE in NSIT.
            I am currently in my final
            year and doing Technical
            Content Writing Internship
            at GeeksForGeeks. I like
            coding all kind of problems
            from the very basic like adding
            numbers to the complex ones like
            competitive programming problems.
            I love making projects and games.
            Infact this website is one of my
            Web Development Projects which
            is built using HTML and CSS.<br>

            C++, JAVA, Python, JavaScript,
